      "ground_truth_answer": "Onboarding a new employee across HRIS, LMS, and IAM involves reading the employee from HRIS, provisioning learning and identity resources in LMS and IAM, and then assigning the correct training and permissions.\n\n1. Get the employee from HRIS:\n- When an employee is created in HRIS (via `POST /unified/hris/employees`), you can fetch their details using:\n  - `GET /unified/hris/employees` to list employees and filter for the new hire; or\n  - `GET /unified/hris/employees/{id}` to fetch a specific employee. HRIS schemas (e.g., `Company`, `ContractTypeEnum`, `BenefitsTypeEnum`) can help determine role, department, and employment type.\n\n2. Provision identity and access in IAM:\n- Create or verify a user in IAM so the employee has an account:\n  - `GET /unified/iam/users` or `GET /unified/iam/users/{id}` to check if a corresponding IAM user already exists.\n  - If supported in the full IAM spec, you would create or update a user (the provided excerpt shows `PATCH /unified/iam/users/{id}` for updates and `DELETE` for removal). Roles and groups are read via:\n    - `GET /unified/iam/roles` and `GET /unified/iam/roles/{id}` for role definitions.\n    - `GET /unified/iam/groups` and `GET /unified/iam/groups/{id}` for groups.\n- Based on HRIS fields (e.g., department, contract type), you map the employee to appropriate IAM roles/groups.\n\n3. Create or sync the user in LMS:\n- Use LMS user listing and detail endpoints:\n  - `GET /unified/lms/users` to list LMS users.\n  - `GET /unified/lms/users/{id}` to fetch a specific LMS user.\n- If user creation is supported in the full LMS spec (not shown in the excerpt), you would create a corresponding LMS user account or otherwise ensure the IAM identity maps to an LMS user via SSO.\n\n4. Assign training in LMS based on HRIS/IAM data:\n- Determine required courses from HRIS job/department or IAM roles/groups.\n- Use LMS assignment endpoints:\n  - `GET /unified/lms/courses` to list available courses.\n  - `GET /unified/lms/courses/{id}` to fetch specific course details.\n  - `POST /unified/lms/users/{id}/assignments` to assign courses or learning items to the new LMS user.\n  - You can retrieve assignments with `GET /unified/lms/users/{id}/assignments`.\n\n5. (Optional) Track completion and compliance:\n- Use `GET /unified/lms/users/{id}/completions` or `GET /unified/lms/completions` to monitor the employee\u2019s training completion.\n\nGeneral order:\nHRIS (employee created \u2192 fetch via `/unified/hris/employees` or `/unified/hris/employees/{id}`) \u2192 IAM (ensure user, roles, and groups via `/unified/iam/users`, `/unified/iam/roles`, `/unified/iam/groups`) \u2192 LMS (ensure user, then assign training via `/unified/lms/users/{id}/assignments` and manage courses via `/unified/lms/courses`).",

      "question": "How can you use the core StackOne API together with a product-specific API (for example, ATS and MARKETING) to inspect request logs for a failed action and then retry that action via the appropriate endpoint? Identify the key StackOne and product endpoints you would use.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "To debug and retry a failed operation, you can use the StackOne core API to inspect logs and metadata, then call the product-specific API (such as ATS or MARKETING) to perform or retry the underlying action.\n\n1. Inspect request and platform logs with StackOne:\n- Use the logging endpoints to find the failed request:\n  - `GET /requests/logs` \u2014 list request logs, potentially filtered by time, connector, or status.\n  - `GET /requests/logs/{id}` \u2014 fetch detailed information about a specific log entry.\n  - `GET /requests/logs/steps` \u2014 inspect detailed step-level logs if supported by query parameters.\n  - `GET /requests/platform-logs` \u2014 examine platform-level logs.\n- These use schemas like `AdvancedLogRequestData`, `AdvancedLogResponseData`, and `AdvancedLogRequestDataUrl` to describe request URLs, payloads, and responses. From the logs, you can identify which API (e.g., ATS or MARKETING), which endpoint, which method, and what payload failed.\n\n2. Identify connector and action metadata, if needed:\n- Use `GET /connectors/meta` or `GET /connectors/meta/{provider}` to understand which provider/connector and resources were involved.\n- Use `GET /actions` to list available unified actions and `POST /actions/rpc` to invoke a pre-defined RPC-style action instead of calling the product-specific endpoint directly.\n\n3. Retry or re-perform the operation on the product API:\n\nExample with ATS:\n- If the log shows that a call to ATS `POST /unified/ats/applications` failed, you can reconstruct the request body from log data and retry:\n  - Directly via the ATS API: `POST /unified/ats/applications`.\n  - Or via a unified proxy or action:\n    - `POST /unified/proxy` to send a proxied request through StackOne if you want to target the downstream system through a generic proxy layer.\n    - `POST /actions/rpc` if there\u2019s an action defined for creating or updating applications.\n\nExample with MARKETING:\n- If the log shows failure for creating an email template via `POST /unified/marketing/templates/email`, you:\n  - Inspect the original payload from the StackOne logs (`/requests/logs` and `/requests/logs/{id}`).\n  - Retry by calling `POST /unified/marketing/templates/email` on the MARKETING API with corrected data.\n  - Similarly, you can update an existing template via `PATCH /unified/marketing/templates/email/{id}` if the failure was during update.\n\n4. Authentication and sessions:\n- Ensure that the API calls (both to StackOne logging endpoints and product endpoints) are authenticated using StackOne\u2019s basic auth scheme. If you are using embedded connections, you may first create or authenticate a connection using:\n  - `POST /connect_sessions` and `POST /connect_sessions/authenticate` from the StackOne API.\n\nIn summary, you:\n- Use StackOne\u2019s core logging endpoints (`/requests/logs`, `/requests/logs/{id}`, `/requests/platform-logs`, `/requests/logs/steps`) plus metadata (`/connectors/meta`, `/actions`, `/actions/rpc`, `/unified/proxy`) to analyze and locate the failed request.\n- Then you retry or reissue the call on the relevant product API endpoint, such as `POST /unified/ats/applications` for ATS or `POST /unified/marketing/templates/email` (and related `PATCH` endpoints) for MARKETING.",
